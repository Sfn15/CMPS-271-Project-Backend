The shell is very interesting to work with.

First of all you have to enable interactive mode for the shell in application.properties before you can do anything.

Second, unning the spring app itself hijacks the terminal, so you can't actually type anything there.

The workaround I used was to force spring shell to use a simple terminal mode by doing the following:

./gradlew bootJar 

and then running the jar with the option

-Djline.terminal=jline.UnsupportedTerminal 

that still didn't work, and the fix for that was adding a --% before it so that powershell would stop interpreting the command
because it messed it up somehow.
